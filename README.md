# eCommerce
This project was a startup to sell food online after we failed to receive financial support I developed it independently

building an eCommerce web application with Django (djangoproject.com) & Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com). I used many technologies including Python, HTML, CSS, JQuery, AJAX, and more.

This is an eCommerce web app using Django for backend, Bootstrap for front-end, Heroku for hosting, and Stripe for payment proccessing (to be implemented).

# Product

The original product was called Como En Casa which offers quality homemade food cooked by selected people living in your own community. Our services make easier to hold a balanced diet based in homemade food and in addition promote employment creation (mainly among housewives) in order to support local economy and increase families' income.
