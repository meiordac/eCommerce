# eCommerce
This is a eCommerce I started writing to improve my Django skills, I am thinking about the possibility of adding some AngularJS or React.

# Initial Setup

You need to have Django and pip installed then you can run the next commands to run the apllication 

```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt  
python manage.py syncdb --migrate
python manage.py runserver

``` 

Then you can open the website in browser at http://localhost:8000/polls or admin at http://localhost:8000/admin (admin:admin)
