# Como En Casa
This is a Start Up that me and two other people created, I am in charge of the development and they are focused on the marketing
and sales. We offer homemade quality food cooked by people living in their own community. 
Our services make it easier to maintain a balanced diet for those who don't have time to cook
and to promote the creation of employment (mainly among women) to support the local economy and increase family income.


# What problem are you solving?
According to CASEN 2009, 27,5% of Chilean women declare to be inactive for being responsible of house tasks. 
Working in TECHO I saw several cases of women willing to work but unable to do so due to house responsibilities. 
This is a common situation both in South America and globally. 
In addition, according to World Bank eating out is an increasing popular practice and demand for balanced alimentation has also increased. 
Homemade food is a response to tackle both problems.

# What solution are you proposing to this particular problem? 

Como en Casa enables you to order quality homemade food cooked by people previously selected and certified on cuisine, 
who are living in your own community. We select these local chefs, train and certify them, 
establish sanitary standards and offer a system where they can offer their food and then be assessed by customers. 
Como en casa is a software as a service solution based on share economy principles as it takes advantage of people's 
free time and their kitchen facilities. 
We enable access to the food market for unemployed people in order to increase their income.
