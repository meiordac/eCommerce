# eCommerce
This project started as startup to sell food online while now is just a normal e-commerce site which I use to improve my Django skills, I am thinking about the possibility of adding some AngularJS or React in the future.

# Initial Setup

You need to have Django and pip installed then you can run the following commands to run the apllication 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

``` 

Then you can open the website in browser at http://localhost:8000/ or the admin site http://localhost:8000/admin
