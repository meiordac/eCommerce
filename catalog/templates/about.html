        Basically the idea is to generate a software as a service in food cooking and delivery. We want to take advantage of the
        concepts of share economy and existing technology to create a platform where local people (basically neighbors) chosen
        by us and who meet certain health standards can offer food throws people / companies around.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this, we want to design a replicable micro-logistics chain within each community in Santiago to generate the transactions.
        Both customer orders, payments and evaluations would be done online. The idea is to generate income sources for middle-class
        / middle-low housewives offering home-made, quality, and healthy food. All this in addition to promoting a balanced
        diet among our customers.
